This package provides a fast and agile Python code to read and parse complex csv files with gigabyes in size. 
We assumed the data size can be several times larger than memaory size and hard dirve. Besides, duplicates are possible which our code can spot and merge. 

Here the given code is desgined to review the data collected from complaints of consumers for some companies. 
One example of the csv files is given in the input folder. Some tests are given in test folder. 


# To run the package, 
  
Navigate to directory that run.sh resides. Make the run.sh file executable and then run it.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/file
$ chmod +x run.sh
$ run.sh
```



Please read My_approach.txt to learn morre about the applied methods. 

Also, file below is uploaded which is the report of a given modest-sized dataset (1GB complaints.csv file provided by Insight).

consumer_complaints/insight_testsuite/test_bigfile/output/report.csv

*** If you want to compile the code directly in Python, you need to change the ***run_bash*** boolean to False.
